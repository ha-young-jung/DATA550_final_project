## Contents of the Repository

`raw_data/`

  - includes the raw_data to generate output and report

`data/`

  - includes the data after preprocessing
  
`code/`

  - includes the code files to preprocess the raw data and create a table1 and plots
  
`output/`

  - includes the output files (table1 and plots)

## Code Description

`code/01_data_preprocessing.R`

  - preprocess the data
  - save the data as a `.rds` object in `data/` folder

`code/02_data_structure_table1.R`

  - create a table1 that describes the data
  - save the table as a `.rds` object in `output/` folder
  
`code/03_make_plots.R`

  - create a bar plot that describes the distribution of urban-rural continuum code.
  - create a histogram that describes the distribution of unemployment rate.
  - save the plots as `.png` objects in `output/` folder
  
`code/04_render_report.R`
  - renders `GA_Opioid_Report.Rmd`

`report.Rmd`

  - imports data generated by `code/01_data_preprocessing.R`
  - reads table1 generated by `code/02_data_structure_table1.R`
  - reads plots generated by `code/03_make_plots.R`

## Contents of the Report

  - The GA_Opioid_Report includes the data set structure, Table1 summarizing the characteristics of variables, maps of each variable, bar plot and histogram showing the distribution of some variables (urban-rural continuum code and unemployment rate), and the results of fitting a Poisson regression model.
  
  - For the maps in the report, I just wrote the code in .rmd files because they required the tmap package and could not be saved as .png flies.
  
## Synchronizing the package repository 
  - My final project directory includes a lock file and renv folder that captures information on the packages used to create the report.
  - Run `make install` command in your terminal to restore the package environment for my project.

## Generating the report
  - Run `make` command in your terminal, and this will sequentially execute the R script files to build the report.
  - If you want to ensure a clean build, run `make clean` command first. This removes any previously generated outputs from the R scripts, ensuring the process works correctly from start to finish.
